The video games mental health charity Safe In Our World is launching the first Mental Health Game Dev Champions event, aimed at empowering gamers and developers to create intimate and personal video games based on real lived-in experiences. 

Game Dev Champions is a worldwide event, encouraging entries from a variety of ages, skills, and diverse backgrounds.

Games are an amazing vehicle to express the difficult and often emotional mental health journey, that people face almost on a daily basis. Through this initiative, and by sharing these experiences, it ensures the creators that their voice is being heard; and for the players, to sample the journey that many people go through, more than often silently.

The event will be judged by an esteemed panel, and winners will receive a selection of prizes provided by our sponsors, that will help gamers develop a career or deeper interest in video game development.
