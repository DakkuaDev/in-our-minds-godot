# In our Minds - Game & Framework

In Our Minds is a development framework and video game made in Godot Engine 4.0 designed for game creators interested in exploring deep, engaging narratives. This project serves as both a solid structural template and a demo that showcases its capabilities, ideal for casual platformer games with emotional depth.


## Project Overview
