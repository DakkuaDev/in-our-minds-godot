# In our Minds 

In our Minds' (Provisional Title), is a **casual-platform videogame**, developed in **Godot Engine 4.0 and GDScript** that tells, through the different scenarios, how complex human emotions are.


## Introduction

‘Inside you is a world of thoughts and emotions, some familiar and some mysterious. You must navigate through them, overcoming the obstacles that the mind itself creates. Every step is an opportunity to understand and move forward.’

## Contribute

As this is an open project but belongs to a [GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/mental-health-game-dev-champions-2024), it's important that you let me know beforehand, if you meet any of the required profiles. If I give you permissions you can clone the repository on your site. At most, **a group of 6 contributors can be formed.**

To get started, you need to work on [Godot 4.2 stable](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2-stable/)

The project uses the [cyclopsLevelBuilder](https://github.com/blackears/cyclopsLevelBuilder) library dependency for level design and prototyping. 

Pending developments are marked in the **Roadmap** section. Look at that section before deciding what you want to help with.

If you make any changes you have two ways to notify me:

- Via a **Pull request** as a separate development branch with the feature or change you want to be integrated. I will manually review it to make sure it is compliant, compatible and functional before integrating it into main.

- Manually, notifying me via **MD on Discord** (dakkuadev)

**Don't use the main branch for development**, always make a copy of the project and create your own branch.

`feature/level-design` `feature/fix-movement` 

If you have doubts about how to do this, please contact me.
